description: "Simon Willison discusses Claude Skills, a new feature that might be more significant than Model Context Protocol. Skills allow you to customize Claude's behavior with persistent instructions and tools, making it easier to create specialized AI assistants without complex integrations."

This is a great example of how AI tooling is evolving. Instead of complex protocols, sometimes simple persistent instructions are exactly what you need. The ability to define skills that Claude remembers across conversations is a game-changer for building specialized workflows.

What's particularly interesting is how this compares to MCP - sometimes the simpler solution (skills) can be more powerful in practice than the more technically sophisticated one (MCP).
