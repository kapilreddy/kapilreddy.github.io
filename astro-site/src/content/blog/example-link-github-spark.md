This is such a clever approach - using an AI tool to reverse engineer and understand the AI tool itself. The meta nature of this is fascinating.

GitHub Spark lets you build micro-apps using natural language, and Simon used it to explore its own capabilities and limitations. This kind of exploratory, playful approach to new tools is exactly how you learn what they're really capable of beyond the marketing materials.
