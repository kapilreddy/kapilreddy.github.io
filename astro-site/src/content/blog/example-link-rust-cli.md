Before reaching for a library or writing custom code, check if there's already a battle-tested CLI tool that does what you need. Tools like `ripgrep`, `fd`, and `jq` have been optimized by thousands of developers and can be orders of magnitude faster.

The real lesson: composition of well-designed tools often beats integration of libraries.
