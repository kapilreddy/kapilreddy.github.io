I am Kapil Reddy. I am a builder and storyteller.\

I started my journey as a Javascripter. Hacked a bunch of POCs some of which survived as production code.
At Helpshift, I also built a core-infra team from 2 engineers to 20 engineers. I have built planet scale (2 Bn devices) distributed systems in Clojure and Python.

Fractional leadership: Tech

The hacker years, I started my journey as a JS + PHP developer. Later, I joined Infinitelybeta where I learnt to build things with Clojure and Python.
Infinitelybeta a product studio narrowed down on building Helphshift. I continued building quick POCs like a co-browsing experience to Android SDKs. Some of them survived to be part of the product even to this day.

The engineering years, The POCs I built worked for a while Helpshift hit PMF. We were on a rocketship. But some of the POCs were not built for this. Shift
