I am a builder and storyteller.\&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started my journey as a Javascripter. Hacked a bunch of POCs some of which survived as production code.
At Helpshift, I also built a core-infra team from 2 engineers to 20 engineers. I have built planet scale (2 Bn devices) distributed systems in Clojure and Python.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fractional leadership: Tech&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hacker years, I started my journey as a JS + PHP developer. Later, I joined Infinitelybeta where I learnt to build things with Clojure and Python.
Infinitelybeta a product studio narrowed down on building Helphshift. I continued building quick POCs like a co-browsing experience to Android SDKs. Some of them survived to be part of the product even to this day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Speaking</title><link>https://example.org/docs/speaking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/docs/speaking/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello welcome to Mugencode! &lt;br>
